## ðŸš€ About Me

I started my programming journey in 2015 in High School with C++, Java and HTML just the basics.

I was excited to become a programmer, but the languages combined with the way they were teached just
didn't sparked joy on what I was learning to be.

Fast track some time played with Python and C++ for specific trading purposes.

So time skipping now 2021 I started again from scratch learning programming languages.

I went for the Front End path because I love the way my code is displayed visually compared to other languages and I just love learning about Front End.

I would say I am a fast learner maybe because due to previous experience or just how I am but also I dedicate many hours daily to it so that plays a big role on it as well.
